# The Pacetify application, created by Jiří Loun

Warning: In the current state, Pacetify does not import any songs 
unless the user is explicitely whitelisted in the Spotify Dashboard
in the Developer section. The reason behind this is that Spotify 
still sees Pacetify as an app in development state, so the requests
from users are restricted. In order to be whitelisted and be able
to use the app, contact me at *514665@mail.muni.cz*.

Note: Pacetify only works if you have Spotify Premium activated
